## 🏥 Project #7 – Secure Healthcare Network Design & Implementation for Melbourne Health Services

This project entails the **secure design and implementation of a multi-site network infrastructure** for *Melbourne Health Services* across two locations. The network supports around **600+ users**, with a strong focus on **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** using **Cisco technologies**.

---

## 🏗️ Scenario Overview

Melbourne Health Services operates two sites within the same city:

### 🏢 Headquarters (HQ)

* **Medical Lead Operation & Consultancy Services (MLOCS)** – 60 users
* **Medical Emergency and Reporting (MER)** – 60 users
* **Medical Records Management (MRM)** – 60 users
* **Information Technology (IT)** – 60 users
* **Customer Service (CS)** – 60 users
* **Guest/Waiting Area (GWA)** – 30 users

### 🏥 Branch Hospital

* **Nurses & Surgery Operations (NSO)** – 30 users
* **Hospital Labs (HL)** – 30 users
* **Human Resources (HR)** – 30 users
* **Marketing (MK)** – 30 users
* **Finance (FIN)** – 30 users
* **Guest/Waiting Area (GWA)** – 30 users

A **dedicated Server Room** at HQ (connected via access switch) hosts:

* **DHCP Server**
* **DNS Server**
* **Web Server**
* **Email Server**

---

## 🧱 Network Design Architecture

### ✔️ Hierarchical Model

* **Core Layer**: 2 Cisco Routers (1 at HQ, 1 at Branch)
* **Distribution Layer**: 2 Multilayer Switches per site
* **Access Layer**: Switches per department

### ✔️ Redundancy & WAN

* Dual ISP connections per site (4 static public IPs: `195.136.17.0/30` to `195.136.17.12/30`)
* Serial WAN connection between HQ and Branch
* Default routes configured for failover

### ✔️ Wireless Infrastructure

* Wireless Access Points per department
* Separate SSIDs per VLAN

### ✔️ VLAN & Subnetting

* **Separate VLAN per department**
* Subnetting from **192.168.100.0/16**
* IP planning based on department size (HQ: 60 users/dept, Branch: 30 users/dept)

### ✔️ IP Addressing

* **Public IPs** (for routers & PAT):

  * `195.136.17.0/30`
  * `195.136.17.4/30`
  * `195.136.17.8/30`
  * `195.136.17.12/30`
* **Private IPs**:

  * DHCP-assigned to end-user devices
  * Static IPs for servers

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### 🔐 Basic Settings

* Hostnames configured
* Console & enable passwords set
* Banner MOTD
* IP domain-lookup disabled

### 🌐 VLANs & Routing

* VLANs for each department
* **Inter-VLAN Routing** on multilayer switches
* **OSPF** used across routers & L3 switches
* **Default static routes** with next-hop IPs

### 🔒 Security & Access

* **SSH** on all routers and L3 switches
* **Port Security** on Server Room switch (1 MAC/sticky, violation: shutdown)
* **Extended ACLs** to filter user access
* **IPSec VPN (Site-to-Site)**: secure encrypted communication HQ ↔ Branch
* **PAT**: public IP NAT via outbound interfaces
* **ACLs**: for VPN, PAT, and departmental restrictions

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

✅ End-to-end VLAN communication
✅ VPN encryption active (HQ ↔ Branch)
✅ DHCP leases successfully assigned
✅ SSH login access to all Layer 3 devices
✅ PAT working with ACL support
✅ Port security triggered when policy violated
✅ OSPF routes advertised and reachable
✅ ACLs correctly limiting traffic per policy
